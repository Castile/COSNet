Our group co-attention achieves a further performance gain (81.1 mean J on DAVIS-16 dataset).

The pre-trained model, testing and training code:

### Quick Start

#### Testing

1. Install pytorch (version:1.0.1).

2. Download the pretrained model. Run 'test_coattention_conf.py' and change the davis dataset path, pretrainde model path and result path.

3. Run command: python test_coattention_conf.py --dataset davis --gpus 0

4. Post CRF processing code: https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf

The pretrained weight can be download from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14ya3ZkneeHsegCgDrvkuFtGoAfVRgErz) or [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16oFzRmn4Meuq83fCYr4boQ), pass code: xwup.

The segmentation results on DAVIS, FBMS and Youtube-objects can be download from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JRPc2kZmzx0b7WLjxTPD-kdgFdXh5gBq) or [BaiduPan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11n7zAt3Lo2P3-42M2lsw6Q), pass code: q37f.

#### Training

1. Download all the training datasets, including MARA10K and DUT saliency datasets. Create a folder called images and put these two datasets into the folder. 

2. Download the deeplabv3 model from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hy0-BAEestT9H4a3Sv78xrHrzmZga9mj). Put it into the folder pretrained/deep_labv3.

3. Change the video path, image path and deeplabv3 path in train_iteration_conf.py.  Create two txt files which store the saliency dataset name and DAVIS16 training sequences name. Change the txt path in PairwiseImg_video.py.

4. Run command: python train_iteration_conf.py --dataset davis --gpus 0,1
